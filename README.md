## Installation

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS to install the integration. Once this is done, the setup process is exactly the same as the default integration: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/control4

## Disclaimer

This integration is essentially a newer version of the Control4 integration that is included in Home Assistant by default, and will receive new updates faster than the default integration.

This means, however, that this custom integration may not be as stable as the default integration, as the code has not gone through Home Assistant's review process and contains the newest, bleeding-edge features.

This integration is not affiliated with or endorsed by Control4.
